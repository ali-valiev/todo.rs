Todo.rs is a blazingly fast cli todo list written in rust

Not recommended for daily use because of lacking features that are crucial.

One of them is storing of the todo list itself. For now it's stored in the heap XD

Will add saving to a file tho

This was a just beginner level learning project to get handy in rust, so don't expect much
