# Todo.rs  
### Blazingly fast cli todo list written in rust ðŸ¦€

### Not recommended for daily use because of crucial lacking features  
One of them is storing of the todo list itself. For now it's stored in the heap XD  
Will add saving to a file tho  
This was a just beginner level learning project to get handy in rust, so don't expect much

If you want to try it out you gotta have rust installed. You can get it from https://rustup.rs/  
Then run this to get the release version:
```
cargo run --release
```
Or this to just compile it in debug mode:
```
cargo run
```
